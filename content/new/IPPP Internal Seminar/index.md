title: Reconstruction of analytical amplitudes across loops, legs and theories
event: IPPP Internal Seminar
event_url: https://conference.ippp.dur.ac.uk/event/851/
location: Durham, UK
summary: IPPP Internal Seminar
abstract: "I will review a technique to obtain analytical spinor-helicity rational coefficients for loop amplitudes from floating-point numerical evaluations, with explicit examples for QCD processes. Afterwards, I will discuss the Cachazo-He-Yuan formalism for massless scattering. I will show how arbitrary-precision numerical solutions of the scattering equations lead to compact analytical tree-level amplitudes in a variety of theories, including the first complete set of five-point $(DF)^2$ amplitudes."
