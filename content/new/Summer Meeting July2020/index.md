title: Analytical Amplitudes from Numerical Exploration
event: Summer Meeting

location: Freiburg, Germany
summary: Freiburg Summer Meeting
abstract: "I will review a technique to obtain analytical spinor-helicity rational coefficients for loop amplitudes from floating-point numerical evaluations. I will then show applications to one-loop QCD amplitudes and beyond."
