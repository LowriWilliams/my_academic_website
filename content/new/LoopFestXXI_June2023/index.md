*Abstract*

I will present the computation of the NNLO double-virtual subleading-color corrections to the production of three photons at hadron colliders. I will briefly review the numerical generalized unitarity computation over finite fields performed with the C++ code Caravel, including updates that made this computation possible. I will then formulate the rational reconstruction problem for the finite remainders in spinor variables and obtain compact analytic expressions. Finally, I will show the effect of the subleading-color corrections on the hard functions.
